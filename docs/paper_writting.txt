    usage description 
        hello everyone, i am going to show you my research project "immersive rigging". 
            The project is about rigging, skinning and animating a given mesh.
        0.when the programm starts, we can see a button wall in front of us. we can use right hand controller to choose the mode we 
            would like to work with in the vr env. and left hand controller to perform some operations. 
        1.The first thing, we have to load a mesh into the scene, by clicking l_demo1/2/... each represents a mesh 
        ///rig 
        2.after that, we can add bone manuelly or load pre-defined skel. or the skel. we saved on disk.  
        lets load it first. 
        as you can see, there is a skel. placed in the middle of the mesh, we can modify it easily. 
            add bone: clicking the grip button on right hand to select "bone addition mode", then, we use left hand controller to add bones. 
                in detail, we have to select the parent bone first. when there is an intersection,   
            modify a bone: ...
            del bone:... touch on the left hand controller 
        ///skinning 
        3.after the bone is adjested, we can get the skel. skined with the pinnoccio library 
            in order to do so, we have to write the skel. to a external file will be feed to pinnoccio, so, click on grip button to do this. 
            then, we perfrom the skinning operation by ckicking this. This may take a well, it depends how camplex our skel. is. 
            after that, we have to apply the attachments to the mesh manuelly, those three steps can be merged to one if needed. 
        ///animation 
        4.let try to animate the mesh! 
            currently, a simple ccd algorithm is imp. the mesh can follow our movements. 
            to do this, we have select the end effectors of both hands, click on this on right hand, and touch on left hand. You should be 
            able to see such lines if ee selected successfully. 
            the same thing for right hand ee. 
            everything is done, we can start ccd now, click the touchpad on positive y axis on left hand controller to start. it will follow 
            our movements. 
        ///recording 
        5.if you wanna record the movements, you should click on recording button first. then, start ccd, and stop recording. to check, 
            you can load it again by this. look, it works!

            Title: Immersive Rigging, Skinning and Motion Capturing 
            Abstract
                The animation of 3d models through rigging and skinning usually involves sophisticated algorithms for fitting skeletons 
                into meshes and motion capturing to gather realistic movement data. Immersed in a VR environment the user finds himself 
                in a familiar coordinate space, where working with 3d models seems more intuitive. We present a simple yet effective 
                application for rigging skinning and motion capturing. Main contributions are: 
                    1. Interactive creation and manipulation of a skeleton in 3d space. (rigging)
                    2. fitting skeletons into meshes. (skinning)
                    3. Use controllers and trackers to animate the skinned mesh. (custom motion capturing algorithm)
                    4. Recording, saving and loading of animations.
