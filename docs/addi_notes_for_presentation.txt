        opti.算法的测试：
            通过c++写算法和数据，通过py显示！ 
            写在omi中！

    ik 
        IK is a ill-posed problem 
        as in example on  the right
        unsolvable
        leading to  oscillations during IK

        several end  effector constraints
        how IK on a whole human body is different from IK on a single arm.

        comfortable with math
        foot placement, arm grabbing door
        configuration space
        fundamental task of IK is to control degrees of freedom to attain goal
        CCD only handles serial chains
        serial chains
        CCD must start at a fixed root

        也是一个最优化问题
        网上有很多最优化问题的c++实现，但是py对于可视化这个东西很方便

    Acclaim ASF/AMC
        https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/ASF-AMC.html
        The Acclaim format is made up of two files, a skeleton file and a motion file
        ASF file (Acclaim Skeleton File)
        AMC file (Acclaim Motion Capture data).
        Each segment has information regarding the way the segment is to be drawn as well as information that can be 
            used for physical dynamics programs, inverse kinematic programs or skinning programs.
